== Same Solution, Different Languages

Okay, sometimes it's a different solution.  For the most part I'm trying to work to the strengths of the language.

.What Else

We are also going to be building out a `dockerfile` for each language so that the examples can exectued on any machine with _Docker_ (tm) installed.

.Wait There's More

_AsciiDoc_ will be the defacto documentation standard, learn it.
