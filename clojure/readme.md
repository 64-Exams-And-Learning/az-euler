# ClojurePlaytime is about learning Clojureabout:startpage

Let's get the environment setup for `Clojure`.
about:startpage
First off I'm running this on a squeeky clean _UBuntu 17.04_ install with _VS Code_.

## Let's go get some useful links to stuff

[Clojure.org](https://clojure.org)

- install the JRE and JDK

```sh
sudo apt-get install default-jre
sudo apt-get install default-jdk
```

> as a side note, I'm not sure if I need to install the JRE if I'm also installing the JDK

Install the `lien` script, in this case I copied it to the `/usr/bin/` folder.

> That another thing I should learn is the _proper_ use of the different **Linux** folders.

Know that we have Leiningen installed, let's run through the tutorial that ships with it.

[Walked Through the Setup](http://www.lispcast.com/clojure-ubuntu) all good.

Started with the `Leiningen` tutorial.

- start the `repl` in the project directory after installation to build and use that project.
